shinier
=======

A package extending package shiny and assisting in the creation of Shiny
interactive web applications

## Features

If you don't know anything about [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/),
you should visit the [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com) folks.  Package
shinier includes functions that may ultimately be included in package shiny.
Other functions don't belong in package shiny and will be maintained here
for the purpose of extending Shiny functionality.

## Installation

The package is in development and may be highly unstable.  I'll try to keep
the master branch in working order on Github, so have a look at my
[Github repository](http://github.com/jayemerson/shinier).  Once it has
some functionality that someone might actually use, I'll put it on CRAN.

## Getting Started

The package includes a sample data set, from the 2012 iteration of the
Yale/Columbia [Environmental Performance Index](http://epi.yale.edu).

## License

The shinier package is licensed under the GPLv3.
